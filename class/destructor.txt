- a constructor builds a class object from the bottom up
- first the constructor invokes its base class constructors
- then it invokes the member constructors
- then it executes its own body

- a destructor tears down an object in reverse order and it is invoked implicitly
- first the destructor executes its own body
- then it invokes the member destructors
- then it invokes its base class destructors
